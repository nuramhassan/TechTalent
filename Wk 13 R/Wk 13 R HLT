# Imagine the following scenario: You are a data analyst at an organisation. You 
# have been given a data set and asked to create a meaningful data visualisation using this data.
# 
# Using the ggplot in-built data sets in RStudio and the qplot
# function, get your creative juices flowing and create a meaningful 
# and impactful data visualization using your preferred data set.

# Seeing what inbuilt datasets are available to me.

# This dataset focuses on the population, economic and education level of 5 states.

# education, population and poverty.

# 1. Looking at each of the 5 states and their population sizes.

# 1. - Write an R program to create three vectors a, b, c with 5 integers.
